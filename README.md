# Bebop: An Audio library for Julia

Bebop is a set of wrappers for the PortAudio library which attempts to
provide a nice, idiomatic interface for manipulating audio.

Currently, Bebop is able to play audio samples from a Julia vector, 
work is in progress to support recording audio, as well as reading and writing
to audio files.
